df.shape()
31 columns, 2 of which are Time and Amount. The rest are output from the PCA transformation. Let's check for missing values:
df.isnull().values.any()
count_classes = pd.value_counts(df['Class'], sort = True)
count_classes.plot(kind = 'bar', rot=0)
plt.title("Transaction class distribution")
plt.xticks(range(2), LABELS)
plt.xlabel("Class")
plt.ylabel("Frequency");
We have a highly imbalanced dataset on our hands. Normal transactions overwhelm the fraudulent ones by a large margin. Let's look at the two types of transactions: 
frauds = df[df.Class == 1]
normal = df[df.Class == 0]
frauds.shape
normal.shape
How different are the amount of money used in different transaction classes?
frauds.Amount.describe()
normal.Amount.describe()
Let's have a more graphical representation:
f, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2, 1, sharex=True)
f.suptitle('Amount per transaction by class')

bins = 50

ax1.hist(frauds.Amount, bins = bins)
ax1.set_title('Fraud')

ax2.hist(normal.Amount, bins = bins)
ax2.set_title('Normal')

plt.xlabel('Amount ($)')
plt.ylabel('Number of Transactions')
plt.xlim((0, 20000))
plt.yscale('log')
plt.show();
Do fraudulent transactions occur more often during certain time?
f, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(2, 1, sharex=True)
f.suptitle('Time of transaction vs Amount by class')

ax1.scatter(frauds.Time, frauds.Amount)
ax1.set_title('Fraud')

ax2.scatter(normal.Time, normal.Amount)
ax2.set_title('Normal')

plt.xlabel('Time (in Seconds)')
plt.ylabel('Amount')
plt.show()
Doesn't seem like the time of transaction really matters.

# Autoencoders

Autoencoders can seem quite bizarre at first. The job of those models is to predict the input, given that same input. Puzzling? Definitely was for me, the first time I heard it.

More specifically, letâ€™s take a look at Autoencoder Neural Networks. This autoencoder tries to learn to approximate the following identity function:

$$\textstyle f_{W,b}(x) \approx x$$

While trying to do just that might sound trivial at first, it is important to note that we want to learn a compressed representation of the data, thus find structure. This can be done by limiting the number of hidden units in the model. Those kind of autoencoders are called *undercomplete*.

Here's a visual representation of what an Autoencoder might learn:

## Reconstruction error

We optimize the parameters of our Autoencoder model in such way that a special kind of error - reconstruction error is minimized. In practice, the traditional squared error is often used:

$$\textstyle L(x,x') = ||\, x - x'||^2$$

If you want to learn more about Autoencoders I highly recommend the following videos by Hugo Larochelle:

# Preparing the data

First, let's drop the Time column (not going to use it) and use the scikit's StandardScaler on the Amount. The scaler removes the mean and scales the values to unit variance:
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

data = df.drop(['Time'], axis=1)

data['Amount'] = StandardScaler().fit_transform(data['Amount'].values.reshape(-1, 1))
Training our Autoencoder is gonna be a bit different from what we are used to. Let's say you have a dataset containing a lot of non fraudulent transactions at hand. You want to detect any anomaly on new transactions. We will create this situation by training our model on the normal transactions, only. Reserving the correct class on the test set will give us a way to evaluate the performance of our model. We will reserve 20% of our data for testing:
X_train, X_test = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2, random_state=RANDOM_SEED)
X_train = X_train[X_train.Class == 0]
X_train = X_train.drop(['Class'], axis=1)

y_test = X_test['Class']
X_test = X_test.drop(['Class'], axis=1)

X_train = X_train.values
X_test = X_test.values
X_train.shape
# Building the model

Our Autoencoder uses 4 fully connected layers with 14, 7, 7 and 29 neurons respectively.  The first two layers are used for our encoder, the last two go for the decoder. Additionally, L1 regularization will be used during training:
input_dim = X_train.shape[1]
encoding_dim = 14
input_layer = Input(shape=(input_dim, ))

encoder = Dense(encoding_dim, activation="tanh", 
                activity_regularizer=regularizers.l1(10e-5))(input_layer)
encoder = Dense(int(encoding_dim / 2), activation="relu")(encoder)

decoder = Dense(int(encoding_dim / 2), activation='tanh')(encoder)
decoder = Dense(input_dim, activation='relu')(decoder)

autoencoder = Model(inputs=input_layer, outputs=decoder)
Let's train our model for 100 epochs with a batch size of 32 samples and save the best performing model to a file. The ModelCheckpoint provided by Keras is really handy for such tasks. Additionally,  the training progress will be exported in a format that TensorBoard understands.
nb_epoch = 100
batch_size = 32

autoencoder.compile(optimizer='adam', 
                    loss='mean_squared_error', 
                    metrics=['accuracy'])

checkpointer = ModelCheckpoint(filepath="model.h5",
                               verbose=0,
                               save_best_only=True)
tensorboard = TensorBoard(log_dir='./logs',
                          histogram_freq=0,
                          write_graph=True,
                          write_images=True)

history = autoencoder.fit(X_train, X_train,
                    epochs=nb_epoch,
                    batch_size=batch_size,
                    shuffle=True,
                    validation_data=(X_test, X_test),
                    verbose=1,
                    callbacks=[checkpointer, tensorboard]).history
autoencoder = load_model('model.h5')
# Evaluation
plt.plot(history['loss'])
plt.plot(history['val_loss'])
plt.title('model loss')
plt.ylabel('loss')
plt.xlabel('epoch')
plt.legend(['train', 'test'], loc='upper right');
The reconstruction error on our training and test data seems to converge nicely. Is it low enough? Let's have a closer look at the error distribution:
predictions = autoencoder.predict(X_test)
mse = np.mean(np.power(X_test - predictions, 2), axis=1)
error_df = pd.DataFrame({'reconstruction_error': mse,
                        'true_class': y_test})
error_df.describe()
## Reconstruction error without fraud
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
normal_error_df = error_df[(error_df['true_class']== 0) & (error_df['reconstruction_error'] < 10)]
_ = ax.hist(normal_error_df.reconstruction_error.values, bins=10)
## Reconstruction error with fraud
fig = plt.figure()
ax = fig.add_subplot(111)
fraud_error_df = error_df[error_df['true_class'] == 1]
_ = ax.hist(fraud_error_df.reconstruction_error.values, bins=10)
from sklearn.metrics import (confusion_matrix, precision_recall_curve, auc,
                             roc_curve, recall_score, classification_report, f1_score,
                             precision_recall_fscore_support)
ROC curves are very useful tool for understanding the performance of binary classifiers. However, our case is a bit out of the ordinary. We have a very imbalanced dataset. Nonetheless, let's have a look at our ROC curve:
fpr, tpr, thresholds = roc_curve(error_df.true_class, error_df.reconstruction_error)
roc_auc = auc(fpr, tpr)

plt.title('Receiver Operating Characteristic')
plt.plot(fpr, tpr, label='AUC = %0.4f'% roc_auc)
plt.legend(loc='lower right')
plt.plot([0,1],[0,1],'r--')
plt.xlim([-0.001, 1])
plt.ylim([0, 1.001])
plt.ylabel('True Positive Rate')
plt.xlabel('False Positive Rate')
plt.show();
The ROC curve plots the true positive rate versus the false positive rate, over different threshold values. Basically, we want the blue line to be as close as possible to the upper left corner. While our results look pretty good, we have to keep in mind of the nature of our dataset. ROC doesn't look very useful for us. Onward...

## Precision vs Recall

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/26/Precisionrecall.svg/350px-Precisionrecall.svg.png" />

Precision and recall are defined as follows:

$$\text{Precision} = \frac{\text{true positives}}{\text{true positives} + \text{false positives}}$$

$$\text{Recall} = \frac{\text{true positives}}{\text{true positives} + \text{false negatives}}$$

Let's take an example from Information Retrieval in order to better understand what precision and recall are. Precision measures the relevancy of obtained results. Recall, on the other hand, measures how many relevant results are returned. Both values can take values between 0 and 1. You would love to have a system with both values being equal to 1.

Let's return to our example from Information Retrieval. High recall but low precision means many results, most of which has low or no relevancy. When precision is high but recall is low we have the opposite - few returned results with very high relevancy. Ideally, you would want high precision and high recall - many results with that are highly relevant.
precision, recall, th = precision_recall_curve(error_df.true_class, error_df.reconstruction_error)
plt.plot(recall, precision, 'b', label='Precision-Recall curve')
plt.title('Recall vs Precision')
plt.xlabel('Recall')
plt.ylabel('Precision')
plt.show()
A high area under the curve represents both high recall and high precision, where high precision relates to a low false positive rate, and high recall relates to a low false negative rate. High scores for both show that the classifier is returning accurate results (high precision), as well as returning a majority of all positive results (high recall).
plt.plot(th, precision[1:], 'b', label='Threshold-Precision curve')
plt.title('Precision for different threshold values')
plt.xlabel('Threshold')
plt.ylabel('Precision')
plt.show()
You can see that as the reconstruction error increases our precision rises as well. Let's have a look at the recall:
plt.plot(th, recall[1:], 'b', label='Threshold-Recall curve')
plt.title('Recall for different threshold values')
plt.xlabel('Reconstruction error')
plt.ylabel('Recall')
plt.show()
Here, we have the exact opposite situation. As the reconstruction error increases the recall decreases.
# Prediction

Our model is a bit different this time. It doesn't know how to predict new values. But we don't need that. In order to predict whether or not a new/unseen transaction is normal or fraudulent, we'll calculate the reconstruction error from the transaction data itself. If the error is larger than a predefined threshold, we'll mark it as a fraud (since our model should have a low error on normal transactions). Let's pick that value:
threshold = 2.9
And see how well we're dividing the two types of transactions:
groups = error_df.groupby('true_class')
fig, ax = plt.subplots()

for name, group in groups:
    ax.plot(group.index, group.reconstruction_error, marker='o', ms=3.5, linestyle='',
            label= "Fraud" if name == 1 else "Normal")
ax.hlines(threshold, ax.get_xlim()[0], ax.get_xlim()[1], colors="r", zorder=100, label='Threshold')
ax.legend()
plt.title("Reconstruction error for different classes")
plt.ylabel("Reconstruction error")
plt.xlabel("Data point index")
plt.show();
I know, that chart might be a bit deceiving. Let's have a look at the confusion matrix:
y_pred = [1 if e > threshold else 0 for e in error_df.reconstruction_error.values]
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(error_df.true_class, y_pred)

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 12))
sns.heatmap(conf_matrix, xticklabels=LABELS, yticklabels=LABELS, annot=True, fmt="d");
plt.title("Confusion matrix")
plt.ylabel('True class')
plt.xlabel('Predicted class')
plt.show()
